# 👋 Hi, I'm Petros — Building Agentic AI Systems for Reasoning & Research

I have extensive experience across business and research, with a specialization in developing statistical, machine learning, deep learning, LLM, and generative AI models. My work focuses on processing and analyzing large-scale, real-world multimodal datasets to support data-driven decision-making. This GitHub account is primarily used to experiment with the latest developments in AI, including emerging frameworks, agentic architectures, and tooling for building intelligent systems.
## 🧠 Technical Focus

**Agentic AI Systems · Multi-Agent Collaboration · Retrieval & RAG · Research Agents · Document Intelligence · Financial AI · Semantic Search · Data Pipelines**

## 🧩 Selected Projects

Here are some recent projects exploring agentic architectures, retrieval pipelines, and LLM-enabled research workflows:

### **1. AgenticAI-A2A for Trip Planning**
Multi-agent travel planning using ADK-A2A + MCP. System queries weather, accommodation, and performs Google research to suggest venues and activities. Designed for multi-turn user queries and multi-tool execution paths.

### **2. A2A Multi-Agent Collaboration**
Explores the agent2Agent (A2A) protocol for structured collaboration. A Host Agent orchestrates Product, Inventory, and Shipping Information Agents to support customer-style queries.

### **3. LangGraph Research Agents**
Graph-based agents using LangGraph with fine-grained state and intermediate step tracing. Models multi-step research workflows with memory and reflection.

### **4. Document Ingestion & Indexing Pipeline**
End-to-end ingestion pipeline using LlamaIndex and OpenAI APIs for indexing, chunking, embedding, and storing documents into OpenSearch + Postgres. Enables scalable semantic search.

### **5. Web Research Agent (Gemini-Inspired)**
Research agent designed for iterative online search. Dynamically generates search terms, evaluates retrieved signals, identifies knowledge gaps, and produces cited answers.

### **6. Deep Financial Research Pipeline**
Domain-specific agent for financial analysis. Includes multimodal loaders (PDF, JSON, txt), embedding models, and time-series data processing for domain research tasks.

### **7. Financial Earnings Q&A**
Plan-and-execute LLM agent that analyzes earnings call transcripts + financial fundamentals to answer complex market questions.

### **8. News Search & Novelty Engine**
Hybrid search engine combining ElasticSearch (sparse) + sentence transformer embeddings (dense) to enable relevance, similarity, and novelty detection across news corpora.
